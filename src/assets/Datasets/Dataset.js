Apple is a company that is known to put ease-of-use as the main goal when designing a product.

You could be watching a TV advert and even before the branding has popped up, you'll know that it's Apple - and that's the sign of a good brand. This consistency runs throughout every channel they have. You can expect the same customer experience when you're visiting their website as you do if you were visiting one of their stores. Their clean modern look and feel can be seen across everything they do and this really helps people become familiar with them, no matter which channel you're choosing to connect with them from.",

Even companies like Apple that stand out as leaders, will continuously evolve so that their audience can always expect something new, fresh and exciting from their latest product launch. This is the reason that they stand as a leader, rather than a follower. In fact, one of their Apple designers was quoted in saying: “Our goals are very simple — to design and make better products. If we can't make something that is better, we won't do it.” If you want to be a leader in your space then you need to continuously evolve. And that doesn't mean find out what your competitors are doing and copy them. Hire researchers and forward thinkers who will drive your company forward and develop new things that your customers are going to love. What started as a computer company, is now famous for its phones, music, TV, and more recently, watch technology. Apple continues to evolve and you should too!",

The story that they convey throughout their marketing is a powerful one. It oozes lifestyle, innovation, passion and style - and why wouldn't you want to be part of that? It's like an exclusive club (never mind that it has millions of members!) So when you buy an Apple product, you're sharing and representing those same ideals that this very brand stands for. And it's not one single thing that can be pin-pointed to this. You can see it in the powerful copy they use on their website, the stylish images in their adverts, and the sleek design of their products. It's all about telling a powerful story that will make your audience want to be a part of everything you do.",

      "The tricky part about answering the question of why people love so much, is that – really – there isn’t just one answer. It’s a mixture of things. There’s brilliant basics from a product point-of-view: a commitment to creating products that are quality, durable, built-to-last, fun, inspiring and easy-to-use. And that’s all wrapped up in this potent lifestyle brand. A sense of identity and exclusivity that somehow persists even as Apple’s market share continues to grow. In many ways you don’t use an Apple product – you become an Apple person. And the bit of gold dust that threads these things together is consistency. Consistent presentation of their brand across all channels, all content. Consistent tone-of-voice. Powerful and instantly recognisable packaging. Bundled together they create a powerful set of values that keep people truly hooked. And, crucially, this isn’t something that’s purely the reserve of Apple. There are other brands, too, which – through a similar approach to brand consistency and product innovation, have become what you might call ‘identity brands.’ LEGO, Converse, IKEA, Starbucks, McDonalds. In the book Lovemarks: The Future Beyond Brands, Kevin Roberts – CEO of Saatchi & Saatchi – coined the term of a ‘lovemark.’ This concept was intended to actually replace the notion of a ‘brand,’ and is defined as a company with an intense emotional connection to its audience.",
